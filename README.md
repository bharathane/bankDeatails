I have deployed this code in render so I'm providing render urls:

deploy link https://vpatrol-bank.onrender.com
my table name is: bank_details
for getting data, use this ling : https://vpatrol-bank.onrender.com/getDetails

for creating or updating data, use this link : https://vpatrol-bank.onrender.com/register/

body for update or creating  accept this manner only : 
{
    "username":"Aayesha",
    "bankAccounts":"Andhra,sbh",
    "bankName":"SBH",
    "branch":"buttaipet"
}


I have create API's for your task only so I have used dummy data. data is not same like that you have mentioned. If you provied any data I will create all API's on that data also.
